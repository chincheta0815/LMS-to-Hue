# LMS-to-Hue bridge

Turns Philips Hue Devices into virtual players that can be used by Logitech Media Server, as disco lights. It is in a very early stage of development and might bear a lot of bugs and easter eggs.

Special Note: Honorable mention has to be made for philippe44 who contributed the base framework and shared a lot of his knowledge in creating this plugin. Without his help this project would not have had the progess it has so far. He created a lot of LMS bridges that are used throughout the community. Please visit https://github.com/philippe44 for an overview on his projects.
